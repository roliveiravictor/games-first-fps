Note:

* **01/11/2014** - This project was first created to follow Alan Thorn's Book practical exercises. Unfortunately, Alan's book is outdated and I've needed to improvise with my own knowledge to go further with this development. Until now, only the above tutorial was used to guide me. By the time I need more information about how to develop X or Y functionality at unreal I will be adding those tutorials here. Also, it's good to mention that to increase my development difficulty, I'v e started challenge from a completely blank project.
